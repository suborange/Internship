/*  HOW TO USE THISE SCRIPT:
 * This is the Base state. All other states do, or can, inherit from this base class. 
 * It contains a Tick() method, and assigns the correct gameobjects and transforms to their respective scripts.  These get inherited from the other States.
 * This class will most likely not change. Changes to this class will affect all the ther state classes.
