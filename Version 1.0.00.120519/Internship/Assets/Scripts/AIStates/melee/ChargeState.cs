/* Ethan Bonavida
 * Enemy Idle State-AI
 * Enemy does nothing, after a # of seconds it will change to another state. 
 * Default new state set to WanderState for both Melee and Ranged. 
 * Boss state is idle until player gets close enough, then it startschasing the player in either-or Melee-Ranged.
 * 
 * 
 * -.DDMMYY
 * 0.0.01 = bug fix, updates, trying small changes
 * 0.1.-  = major changes, rewriting, changed logic  
 * 1.0.00 = GOLD?
 * Version: 
 * 0.0.00.112219; Created script
 * -.01.112919; add functionality and made sure it does work with the boss phase
 * -.01.120119; rechecked logic, added in-depth comments. 
 * 1.0.01.120319; GOLD? 
 * 1.2.00.120419; Finalized touches, everything works in here(I really think) - GOLD!
